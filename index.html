                    </header>
                    <article>
                        <p>Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout model that lays out or aligns items within a container regarless of whether
                            the size of the items is unknown or dynamic, hence the word "Flex". The main idea behind the flex layout is to give 
                            the container the ability to alter its items' width/height (and order) to best fill the available space (mostly
                             to accommodate to all kind of display devices and screen sizes). A flex container expands items to fill 
                             available free space, or shrinks them to prevent overflow.</p>
                        <p>Most importantly, the flexbox layout is direction-agnostic as opposed to the regular layouts (block which is 
                            vertically-based and inline which is horizontally-based). While those work well for pages, they lack flexibility 
                            (no pun intended) to support large or complex applications (especially when it comes to orientation changing, 
                            resizing, stretching, shrinking, etc.).</p>

                        <p>For a long time, the only reliable cross browser-compatible tools available for creating CSS layouts were things
                             like floats and positioning. These are fine and they work, but in some ways they are also rather limiting and frustrating.</p>
                        <p>The following simple layout requirements are either difficult or impossible to achieve with such tools, in any 
                            kind of convenient, flexible way:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Vertically centering a block of content inside its parent.</li>
                            <li>Making all the children of a container take up an equal amount of the available width/height, regardless 
                                of how much width/height is available.</li>
                            <li>Making all columns in a multiple column layout adopt the same height even if they contain a different amount of content.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Since flexbox is a whole module and not a single property, it involves a lot of things including its whole set of properties
                            and other factors that affect its behavior. Here are some terms to familiarize:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Main axis</strong> - The main axis of a flex container is the primary axis along which flex items are laid out. 
                                Beware, it is not necessarily horizontal; it depends on the flex-direction property.</li>
                            <li><strong>Main-start | Main-end</strong> - The flex items are placed within the container starting from main-start and 
                                going to main-end.</li>
                            <li><strong>Main size</strong> - A flex item's width or height, whichever is in the main dimension, is the item's main size. 
                                The flex item's main size property is either the &#34;width&#34; or &#34;height&#34; property, whichever is in the main dimension.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cross axis</strong> - The axis perpendicular to the main axis is called the cross axis. Its direction depends 
                                on the main axis direction.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cross-start | Cross-end</strong> - Flex lines are filled with items and placed into the container starting on 
                                the cross-start side of the flex container and going toward the cross-end side.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cross size</strong> - The width or height of a flex item, whichever is in the cross dimension, is the item's 
                                cross size. The cross size property is whichever of &#34;width&#34; or &#34;height&#34; that is in the cross dimension.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Display</h3>
                        <p>This defines a flex container; inline or block depending on the given value. It enables a flex context for all its 
                            direct children.</p>
                        <p><em>Note: All these properties are set in the CSS file or within the style element.</em></p>
                        <pre>

                        <p>This establishes the main-axis, thus defining the direction flex items are placed in the flex container. Flexbox is 
                            (aside from optional wrapping) a single-direction layout concept. Think of flex items as primarily laying out either 
                            in horizontal rows or vertical columns.</p>

                        <p>This is a shorthand <strong>flex-direction</strong> and <strong>flex-wrap</strong> properties, which together define

                            on a line are inflexible, or are flexible but have reached their maximum size. It also exerts some control over the alignment
